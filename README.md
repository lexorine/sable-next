# <img src="src/lib/assets/res/svg/logo.svg" alt="Sable" width="32" height="32"> Sable v2

A from-scratch rewrite of [Sable](https://github.com/SableClient/Sable), with Svelte and Rust.

Join the Matrix space at [#sable:sable.moe](https://matrix.to/#/#sable:sable.moe) to discuss the project and meowing.

The development web build is deployed to [next.sable.moe](https://next.sable.moe/).
See [`infra/README.md`](infra/README.md) for the Cloudflare Worker and OpenTofu
setup.

## Getting started

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) manages Node, pnpm, Rust, and other tooling.

```bash
mise install
mise run setup    # pnpm install + git hooks
mise run dev      # SvelteKit on http://localhost:3000
```

`mise run dev` builds the development WASM bundle first. While editing Rust in
another terminal, run `mise run wasm:watch`; Vite reloads after each regenerated
bundle. Production builds generate the optimised WASM bundle automatically.

`pnpm test:e2e` generates its WASM bundle in `src/generated/wasm-e2e/`, so it
can run while the development server is using `src/generated/wasm/`.

Run `mise tasks` for the full list.

## Apps (Tauri)

Native builds use [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app). Targets: **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, **Android**, and **iOS**.

```bash
mise run tauri:setup          # Shared Rust/system dependencies, including Linux packages
mise run tauri:icons          # Regenerate native icons after changing the logo SVG
mise run tauri dev            # Run the app for the current desktop OS
mise run tauri:setup:windows  # Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools + WebView2
mise run tauri:setup:macos    # macOS: Xcode
mise run tauri:setup:android  # Android: SDK packages + NDK
mise run tauri:setup:ios      # iOS: Xcode project + CocoaPods (macOS)
```

Every push to `main` publishes bundles for all five targets as a distinct
[nightly prerelease](https://git.sable.moe/SableClient/sable-next/releases).
Linux x86_64 and Android build here; macOS, Windows, iOS and Linux aarch64
build on the GitHub mirror and attach their bundles, with attestations, to the
same release. Tagged releases are not set up yet.

The web build ships with every release as `sable-next-<version>-web.tar.gz`.
Extract it into your web root to serve the app yourself; see
[`Caddyfile`](Caddyfile) for an example configuration.

### Console output

Run with `--verbose` to print webview console messages to stderr (CEF and Wry).
In development: `pnpm tauri dev -- -- --verbose`.
Quit any running instance before restarting with the flag.

### Proxy

Start a desktop app with `--proxy` to send all of its traffic through an HTTP
or SOCKS5 proxy, for example `--proxy=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050`. On Windows, add
it to the end of the shortcut's Target, after the quoted path.
A SOCKS5 proxy also resolves host names, so lookups do not leave the proxy. An
invalid value shows an error and quits rather than starting without the proxy.

## Linux (Flatpak)

Nightly builds have their own Flatpak remote, rebuilt from `main` on every push:

```sh
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists sable-next-nightly https://sableclient.github.io/sable-next/sable-next-nightly.flatpakrepo
flatpak install sable-next-nightly moe.sable.next.Nightly
```

Built by the `build-nightly-flatpak` and `publish-nightly-flatpak` jobs in
[`tauri-build.yml`](.github/workflows/tauri-build.yml).

## Android (Obtainium)

APKs ship with every build, and [Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev) updates them straight from Forgejo. Each build also publishes an `obtainium.json` app config.

### Setup & install

1. Install [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases/latest).
2. Tap **Add to Obtainium** above. It enables prereleases and selects the nightly build releases.
3. Or download `obtainium.json` and import it with **Import/Export → Import from file**.

Apps added before the move to per-build prereleases have to be removed and re-added.

## iOS (AltStore / SideStore)

iOS builds are unsigned IPAs distributed through [AltStore](https://altstore.io) and [SideStore](https://sidestore.io). Each nightly publishes its IPA in its own prerelease; `altstore-source.json` lists them.

<a href="https://intradeus.github.io/http-protocol-redirector?r=altstore://source?url=https://git.sable.moe/SableClient/sable-next/releases/download/nightly/altstore-source.json"><img alt="Add to AltStore" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Add_to_AltStore-7C3AED?style=for-the-badge"></a>

### Setup & install

1. Set up [AltStore Classic](https://faq.altstore.io/altstore-classic/altserver) or [SideStore](https://docs.sidestore.io) on your device.
2. Tap a button above, or add the source manually:
   - AltStore: `altstore://source?url=https://git.sable.moe/SableClient/sable-next/releases/download/nightly/altstore-source.json`
   - SideStore: `sidestore://source?url=https://git.sable.moe/SableClient/sable-next/releases/download/nightly/altstore-source.json`
3. Install Sable v2 from the source. AltStore/SideStore re-sign the unsigned IPA with your personal development certificate at install time, so apps refresh every 7 days on a free account.

Both configs come from the `obtainium` and `altstore` jobs in [`tauri-build.yml`](.forgejo/workflows/tauri-build.yml).
